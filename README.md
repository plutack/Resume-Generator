# Resume generator
 This is a simple repo that allows easy iteration of resumes leveraging git branches and github actions to generate a pdf and html file leveraging github actions.


Update: I added a Makefile since I can just install Pandoc and WkHtmltopdf and run locally so github actions file are now commented out.
